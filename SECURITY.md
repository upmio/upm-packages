## Security Reporting

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly. We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

#### How to Report

Send your report to: **security@upmio.com**

Include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested mitigations or fixes
- Your contact information for follow-up

#### What to Expect

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We will provide an estimated timeline for addressing the issue
- We will keep you informed of our progress
- We will coordinate disclosure with you
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Supported Versions

| Version                | Security Support |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Latest release         | ✅               |
| Previous major version | ✅ (90 days)     |
| Older versions         | ❌               |

We provide security updates for the latest release and the previous major version for 90 days after the new release.

## Security Practices

### Container Security

- **Non-root execution**: All containers run as UID 1001
- **Minimal base images**: Use minimal base images to reduce attack surface
- **Multi-stage builds**: Separate build and runtime environments
- **Security contexts**: Proper pod and container security contexts
- **Resource limits**: Implement resource constraints to prevent DoS

### Password Management

- **OpenSSL encryption**: All passwords are encrypted using AES-256-CBC
- **Secure storage**: Passwords are stored in encrypted format
- **Environment variables**: Sensitive data passed through environment variables
- **Key rotation**: Regular key rotation policies

### Network Security

- **TLS encryption**: All communications use TLS 1.2+
- **Firewall rules**: Proper network segmentation
- **Service discovery**: Secure service discovery mechanisms
- **Port management**: Minimal exposed ports

### Access Control

- **RBAC**: Role-based access control for Kubernetes
- **Least privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
- **Session management**: Secure session handling

## Vulnerability Management

### Scanning Tools

We use the following tools for vulnerability scanning:

- **Trivy**: Container image vulnerability scanning
- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability detection
- **ShellCheck**: Shell script security analysis
- **Yamllint**: YAML configuration validation

### Response Process

1. **Identification**: Vulnerability discovered or reported
2. **Assessment**: Impact analysis and risk evaluation
3. **Mitigation**: Develop and test fixes
4. **Deployment**: Release security patches
5. **Notification**: Inform users and update documentation

### Patch Management

- **Critical**: Within 24 hours
- **High**: Within 72 hours
- **Medium**: Within 7 days
- **Low**: Within 30 days

## Dependencies

### Third-Party Components

We regularly update and scan all third-party dependencies:

- **Base images**: Regular security updates
- **Helm charts**: Dependency updates
- **Libraries**: Security patching
- **Tools**: Version management

### Supply Chain Security

- **Signed images**: All container images are signed
- **SBOM**: Software Bill of Materials available
- **Provenance**: Build and deployment provenance tracking
- **Integrity checks**: Artifact verification

## Compliance

### Standards Compliance

- **Kubernetes security best practices**: Follows Kubernetes security guidelines
- **CIS benchmarks**: CIS Docker and Kubernetes benchmarks
- **NIST standards**: NIST cybersecurity framework alignment
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy compliance

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at rest**: All data encrypted using AES-256
- **Encryption in transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **Key management**: Secure key generation and storage
- **Data retention**: Minimal data retention policies

## Threat Model

### Common Threats

#### Container Threats

- **Container escape**: Prevention through security contexts
- **Image tampering**: Image signing and verification
- **Resource exhaustion**: Resource limits and monitoring

#### Network Threats

- **Eavesdropping**: TLS encryption for all communications
- **Man-in-the-middle**: Certificate validation
- **DDoS attacks**: Rate limiting and resource constraints

#### Application Threats

- **SQL injection**: Parameter validation and sanitization
- **Authentication bypass**: Multi-factor authentication
- **Privilege escalation**: Least privilege principle

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Defense in depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Zero trust**: Verify all requests
- **Least privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Continuous monitoring**: Real-time threat detection

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing

- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing
- **DAST**: Dynamic Application Security Testing
- **SCA**: Software Composition Analysis
- **Container scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans

### Manual Testing

- **Penetration testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Code review**: Security-focused code reviews
- **Architecture review**: Security design validation
- **Configuration review**: Security setting validation

## Incident Response

### Incident Classification

- **Critical**: System compromise, data breach
- **High**: Service disruption, unauthorized access
- **Medium**: Security misconfiguration, vulnerability exposure
- **Low**: Policy violation, minor security issue

### Response Team

- **Security Lead**: Coordinates response efforts
- **Development Team**: Implements fixes
- **Operations Team**: Deploys patches
- **Communications**: Handles external communications

### Post-Incident

- **Root cause analysis**: Determine underlying causes
- **Impact assessment**: Evaluate damage and scope
- **Lessons learned**: Improve security practices
- **Documentation**: Update security documentation
